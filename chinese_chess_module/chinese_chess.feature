Feature: Chinese Chess (象棋) Rules
  As a player
  I want to follow standard Chinese Chess rules
  So that I can play the game correctly

  We use (row, col) to indicate positions on a 9×10 board.
  Row 1 is Red’s bottom row; Row 10 is Black’s top row.
  Column 1 is the leftmost column from Red’s perspective.
  
  Each scenario sets up minimal conditions with relevant pieces.
